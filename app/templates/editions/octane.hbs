<h1>The Octane Edition of Ember</h1>
<p class="intro">
  The <strong>preview</strong> of Ember Octane is underway! Octane's features are available in a stable release of Ember, v3.13 onward.
  However, it is not yet the recommended default.
  We need your help polishing up the work-in-progress learning resources linked below, popular addons, and tools like Ember Inspector or codemods.
  You can read more about the plan and timeline in
  <a href="https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/08/15/octane-release-plan.html">the Octane release plan blog post</a>
  and
  <a href="https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/10/31/octane-release-update.html">the update</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Ember Octane describes a set of new features that, when taken together, represent a foundational improvement to the way you use Ember.
  It has modern, streamlined components and state management that make it fun to build web applications.
  With seamless interoperability for existing apps, teams can migrate at their own pace, while developers building new apps start out with the best that Ember has to offer.

<h2>Are you adventurous and want to test each of the features out?</h2>
<p>
  All features of Octane are presently landed in the latest version of ember,
  but if you'd like to try pieces of Octane before upgrading all the way to 3.14+,
  you may find the below helper: a quick reference of each of the features, and when you can use them.

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<dl class="dl-faq">
  <dt>When will Octane be ready?</dt>
  <dd>
    Octane will be available as an upcoming minor release of Ember.
    That means all features are opt-in and non-breaking for existing apps.
    It was originally targeted for 3.14, but it needs more work before the edition can be declared.
    For timeline details, read the <a href="https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/10/31/octane-release-update.html">Octane release update</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt>I'm starting a new app at work. Should I use Octane?</dt>
  <dd>
    Octane is in <em>preview</em> mode- there are bound to be rough edges in popular addons and tools. We advise that Octane style only be used in v3.13 apps by developers who are committed to helping iron out any issues. Developers are encouraged to update their apps to the latest version of Ember in the same way they always would. v3.13 is production-ready and has the stability guarantees that minor releases always have. Octane's opt-in features will get more ecosystem support and documentation built up in the meantime.
